            <p class="text-center text-muted">
                Outside of academics and work, I am actively involved in leadership roles and extracurricular activities. 
                I’ve competed in case competitions focused on digital transformation and ERP simulations, represented my program as a student ambassador, and cycled in the Men's Little 500 team.
                My passion for technology and problem-solving extends beyond the classroom into every aspect of my life.
